                <h2>What's happening?</h2>
                <p>It’s May and while we’re all delighted that Spring is springing (in this timezone, anyways) we’re a little sad that we won’t be meeting our friends, old and new, in Odense this year for Codegarden 2020. We’re all doing our best to adjust to this new normal and although we are quite happy to hunker down a while and stay safe, we thought we’d bring a little corner of Codegarden to those who will miss what was, for many, the highlight of the Umbraco calendar.</p>
                <p>We’d like to welcome you to join us at the CanCon CodePatch event - join us for some friendly chat. We promise to create a space for people to get to know each other; a safe environment for people to share ideas and ultimately, a place to hack while listening to cheesy 90s music on a discord channel.</p>
